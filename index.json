Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis.   Setting 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020).   Participants 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2.   Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C.   Results  Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56% (367/650) were male. 57% (330/576) were white, 12% (67/576) South Asian, and 10% (56/576) black. 42% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; Ptextless0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64% (29/45) v 42% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73% (38/52) v 15% (62/404); Ptextless0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51% (24/47) v 28% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34% (16/47) v 10% (26/263); Ptextless0.001), myalgia (34% (15/44) v 8% (21/270); Ptextless0.001), sore throat (30% (14/47) v (12% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20% (9/46) v 3% (10/318); Ptextless0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150 × 10 9 /L (32% (16/50) v 11% (38/348); Ptextless0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C. No deaths occurred in the MIS-C group.    Conclusions Children and young people have less severe acute covid-19 than adults. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric symptom cluster was also identified in acute cases that shares features with MIS-C. This study provides additional evidence for refining the WHO MIS-C preliminary case definition. Children meeting the MIS-C criteria have different demographic and clinical features depending on whether they have acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction positive) or are post-acute (antibody positive).

Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. The clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms can influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making: for example, significant differential therapeutic effects in sub-groups of patients with different severities of respiratory failure have already been reported for the only treatment so far shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19, dexamethasone. We obtained structured clinical data on 68914 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 33468 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 35446 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in separate cohort of community cases. A core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea co-occurred with additional symptoms in three patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were common, and a subgroup of patients reported few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis using a further 35446 individuals subsequently recruited to ISARIC-4C. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","tags":null,"title":"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Milly Lo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583499600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583499600,"objectID":"45298c1c85a740fd5e7f17d126e4ae0c","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/d2d/lo/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T22:34:51Z","relpermalink":"/d2d/lo/","section":"d2d","summary":"Much of the routine data generated during the provision of medical care in critical care units is discarded rather than fully used to help clinicians improve treatments.

Experimental evaluation of all these materials for specific applications is not feasible, and as a result, this prompted the development of high throughput computational screening methods. In this presentation, I will reflect on the development of the multiscale strategies that combine molecular simulations and pressure swing adsorption modelling and optimization to predict performance of the materials on the process scale. Specifically, I will focus on the challenges associated with the interface between molecular and process levels of description and demonstrate that the emerging picture is quite complex. As a case study, a well-known 4-step vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) cycle with light product pressurization (LPP), and Zeolite 13X as adsorbent in application to carbon dioxide removal from a typical flue gas stream (15% CO2, 85% N2, 1 atm) will be considered. I will discuss (a) the effect of the protocol for fitting experimental adsorption data with analytical adsorption models (e.g. dual-site Langmuir model), (b) influence of the pellet porosity and (c) influence of the pellet size on the process performance and material raking. Another aspect of the multiscale strategies we intend to explore is the accuracy of the molecular force fields, particularly in reproducing nitrogen isotherms, and how this affects predictions for the performance of the material in a process and the resulting ranking.","tags":[],"title":"From Crystal to Adsorption Column: Challenges in Multiscale Computational Screening of Materials for Adsorption Separation Processes","type":"d2d"},{"authors":["Debaditya Choudhury","Michael G Tanner","Sarah McAughtrie","Fei Yu","Bethany Mills","Tushar R Choudhary","Sohan Seth","Thomas H Craven","James M Stone","Ioulia K Mati","Colin J Campbell","Mark Bradley","Christopher K I Williams","Kevin Dhaliwal","Timothy A Birks","Robert R Thomson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d58477879a07546e5a3d51284ff397a8","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/publication/choudhury-endoscopic-2019/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T20:57:34.294731Z","relpermalink":"/publication/choudhury-endoscopic-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Endoscopic sensing of distal lung physiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sohan Seth","Ahsan R.

In pulmonary FCFM some cells can display autofluorescence, and they appear as disc like objects in the FCFM images, whereas bacteria, although not autofluorescent, appear as bright blinking dots when exposed to a targeted smartprobe. Estimating bacterial and cellular load becomes a challenging task due to the presence of background from autofluorescent human lung tissues, i.e., elastin, and imaging artifacts from motion etc. We create a database of annotated images for both these tasks where bacteria and cells were annotated, and use these databases for supervised learning. We extract image patches around each pixel as features, and train a classifier to predict if a bacterium or cell is present at that pixel.

The optrode consisted of an asymmetric dual-core optical fiber designed for spatially separating the optical pump delivery and signal collection, in order to circumvent the unwanted Raman signal generated within the fiber. Using this approach, we demonstrate a ~100-fold increase in SERS signal-to-fiber background ratio, and demonstrate multiple site pH sensing with a measurement accuracy of ± 0.07 pH units in the respiratory acini of an ex vivo ovine lung model.

The investigation of pulmonary nodules is time-consuming and often leads to protracted follow-up with ongoing radiological surveillance, however, clinical calculators that assess the risk of the nodule being malignant exist to help in the stratification of patients. Furthermore recent advances in interventional pulmonology include the ability to both navigate to nodules and also to perform autofluorescence endomicroscopy. In this study we assessed the efficacy of incorporating additional information from label-free fibre-based optical endomicrosopy of the nodule on assessing risk of malignancy. Using image analysis and machine learning approaches, we find that this information does not yield any gain in predictive performance in a cohort of patients. Further advances with pulmonary endomicroscopy will require the addition of molecular tracers to improve information from this procedure.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the utility of autofluorescence-based pulmonary optical endomicroscopy to predict the malignant potential of solitary pulmonary nodules in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Blomstedt","Ritabrata Dutta","Sohan Seth","Alvis Brazma","Samuel Kaski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"4b2658a1a476866136b44c7963025559","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/publication/blomstedt-modelling-based-2016/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T20:57:34.263939Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blomstedt-modelling-based-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modelling-based experiment retrieval: a case study with gene expression clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sohan Seth","Manuel J.

The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real–valued.

In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal soccer players based on performance data, archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.","tags":["Archetypal analysis","Binary observation","Convex hull","Majorization–minimization","Probabilistic modeling","Visualization"],"title":"Probabilistic archetypal analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rosha Pokharel","Sohan Seth","Jose C.

This technical advancement has initiated the trend of sequencing multiple samples in different conditions or environments to explore the similarities and dissimilarities of the microbial communities. Examples include the human microbiome project and various studies of the human intestinal tract. With the availability of ever larger databases of such measurements, finding samples similar to a given query sample is becoming a central operation. Results: In this paper, we develop a content-based exploration and retrieval method for whole metagenome sequencing samples. We apply a distributed string mining framework to efficiently extract all informative sequence k-mers from a pool of metagenomic samples and use them to measure the dissimilarity between two samples. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two human gut metagenome data sets as well as human microbiome project metagenomic samples. We observe significant enrichment for diseased gut samples in results of queries with another diseased sample and very high accuracy in discriminating between different body sites even though the method is unsupervised.

Developing such tools, however, is difficult due to the lack of Euclidean structure of the spike train space, and an experimenter usually prefers simpler tools that capture only limited statistical features of the spike train, such as mean spike count or mean firing rate. We explore strictly positive-definite kernels on the space of spike trains to offer both a structural representation of this space and a platform for developing statistical measures that explore features beyond count or rate. We apply these kernels to construct measures of divergence between two point processes and use them for hypothesis testing, that is, to observe if two sets of spike trains originate from the same underlying probability law. Although there exist positive-definite spike train kernels in the literature, we establish that these kernels are not strictly definite and thus do not induce measures of divergence. We discuss the properties of both of these existing nonstrict kernels and the novel strict kernels in terms of their computational complexity, choice of free parameters, and performance on both synthetic and real data through kernel principal component analysis and hypothesis testing.","tags":null,"title":"Strictly Positive-Definite Spike Train Kernels for Point-Process Divergences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sohan Seth","José C.

However, existing methods of assessing conditional dependence, such as the conditional mutual information, are computationally expensive, involve free parameters, and are difficult to understand in the context of realizations. In this letter, we discuss a novel approach to this problem and develop a computationally simple and parameter-free estimator. The difference between the proposed approach and the existing ones is that the former expresses conditional dependence in terms of a finite set of realizations, whereas the latter use random variables, which are not available in practice. We call this approach conditional association, since it is based on a generalization of the concept of association to arbitrary metric spaces.
