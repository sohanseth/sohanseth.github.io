We demonstrate a new method of describing crystal structures based on interatomic distances, termed the Grouped Representation of Interatomic Distances (GRID). This fast to compute descriptor can equally be applied to crystalline or disordered materials, and encodes additional information beyond pairwise distances, such as coordination environments. Combined with earth mover's distance as a measure of similarity, we show that GRID is able to quantitatively compare materials involving both short- and long-range structural variation. Using this new material descriptor, we show that it can accurately predict bulk moduli using a simple nearest-neighbour model, and that the resulting similarity shows good generalisability across multiple materials properties.","tags":null,"title":"Grouped representation of interatomic distances as a similarity measure for crystal structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra C.

Although censuses can provide this information, they are typically conducted every 10 years with some countries having forgone the process for several decades. Population can change in the intercensal period due to rapid migration, development, urbanisation, natural disasters, and conflicts. Census-independent population estimation approaches using alternative data sources, such as satellite imagery, have shown promise in providing frequent and reliable population estimates locally. Existing approaches, however, require significant human supervision, for example annotating buildings and accessing various public datasets, and therefore, are not easily reproducible. We explore recent representation learning approaches, and assess the transferability of representations to population estimation in Mozambique. Using representation learning reduces required human supervision, since features are extracted automatically, making the process of population estimation more sustainable and likely to be transferable to other regions or countries. We compare the resulting population estimates to existing population products from GRID3, Facebook (HRSL) and WorldPop. We observe that our approach matches the most accurate of these maps, and is interpretable in the sense that it recognises built-up areas to be an informative indicator of population.","tags":null,"title":"Census-independent population estimation using representation learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan E.

Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. However, it is the clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms which influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. In this study, we applied clustering techniques to a large prospective cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 to identify clinically meaningful sub-phenotypes. We obtained structured clinical data on 59,011 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 25,477 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 33,534 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in 4,445 cases recruited to a separate study of community cases. Unsupervised clustering identified distinct sub-phenotypes. First, a core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea, which co-occurred with additional symptoms in three further patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were also identified, alongside a sub-phenotype of patients reporting few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom sub-phenotypes were highly consistent in replication analysis within the ISARIC-4C study. Similar patterns were externally verified in patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of the ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four sub-phenotypes are usefully distinct from the core symptom group: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms.","tags":null,"title":"Distinct clinical symptom patterns in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in an analysis of 59,011 patients in the ISARIC-4C study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gary R.

Persistent symptoms following infection have been reported in CYP but subsequent healthcare use is unclear. We aim to describe healthcare use in CYP following community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify those at risk of ongoing healthcare needs.   Methods and analysis We will use anonymised individual-level, population-scale national data linking demographics, comorbidities, primary and secondary care use and mortality between 1 January 2019 and 1 May 2022. SARS-CoV-2 test data will be linked from 1 January 2020 to 1 May 2022. Analyses will use Trusted Research Environments: OpenSAFELY in England, Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank in Wales and Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland (EAVE-II). CYP aged ≥4 and textless18 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) testing between 1 January 2020 and 1 May 2021 and those untested CYP will be examined. The primary outcome measure is cumulative healthcare cost over 12 months following SARS-CoV-2 testing, stratified into primary or secondary care, and physical or mental healthcare. We will estimate the burden of healthcare use attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections in the 12 months after testing using a matched cohort study of RT-PCR positive, negative or untested CYP matched on testing date, with adjustment for confounders. We will identify factors associated with higher healthcare needs in the 12 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection using an unmatched cohort of RT-PCR positive CYP. Multivariable logistic regression and machine learning approaches will identify risk factors for high healthcare use and characterise patterns of healthcare use post infection.   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the South-Central Oxford C Health Research Authority Ethics Committee (13/SC/0149). Findings will be preprinted and published in peer-reviewed journals.

Surgical repair is usually performed in infancy; however, there are concerning inequalities in access to and quality of surgical care. Scoring aesthetic results after surgery is crucial when determining the success of a repair. A reliable and accurate scoring system utilising large numbers of unstandardised 2-dimentional (2D) photographs of ethnically diverse patients, which is inexpensive, widely accepted and easily applicable, does not exist. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied in various surgical specialities with beneficial results; however, its advantages have not yet been harnessed in cleft care. We aimed to evaluate the potential use of routinely collected 2D photographs of patients with an orofacial cleft and determine if non-standardised data could be used for machine learning (ML) analysis in cleft research.   Method A database comprising over 5 million photographs, collected over 20 years, and developed by the international non-governmental organisation Smile Train, was described, and analysed using RStudio and Microsoft Excel.   Results Description and analysis of the dataset demonstrated that it is the largest and most ethnically inclusive and diverse dataset that currently exists. Preliminary AI analysis confirmed that ML could be used to analyse the data.   Conclusion The quality of routinely collected data presents challenges for use in research. Addressing such challenges helps ensure that findings are more representative of global burden of disease and will deliver outcomes that are more relevant to a diverse global population. Evidence based minimum standards to optimise future data collection have been identified.","tags":null,"title":"616 Addressing Challenges to Enable Better Use of Routinely Collected Clinical Photographs: Evaluating the Largest Cleft Dataset for Machine Learning Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruizhi Zhang","Sohan Seth","James Cumby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"ce6fefe2c91013da9e9958a22c7eb043","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/publication/zhang-grouped-2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-17T12:26:38.673882Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-grouped-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Determining how similar two materials are in terms of both atomic composition and crystallographic structure remains a challenge, the solution of which would enable generalised machine learning using crystal structure data.

This fast to compute descriptor can equally be applied to crystalline or disordered materials, and encodes additional information beyond pairwise distances, such as coordination environments. Combined with earth mover’s distance as a measure of similarity, we show that GRID is able to quantitatively compare materials involving both short- and long-range structural variation.

In collision zones, prograde metamorphism occurs by gradual increase of pressure and temperature [1; 2]. Among the most important prograde mineral reactions are dehydration reactions, which are characterized by solid volume reduction, porosity creation, fluid release and high pore fluid pressures [3]. Most models linking dehydration and mechanical instabilities [4-6] involve feedback loops between coupled chemical, hydraulic and mechanical processes. Feedbacks control pore fluid pressure build-up and drainage, and provide efficient pathways for the transport of chemical components. Gypsum dehydration is crucial in the formation of detachment faults thin-skinned tectonics [7]. It is also used as a proxy for serpentine dehydration and the generation of intermediate depth seismic events/aseismic slip activity [8].\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We performed a set of experimental gypsum dehydrations both at the TOMCAT microtomography beamline at the Swiss Light Source, and in the laboratory. Using a modified version of the Mjolnir triaxial rig [9] that allowed control of pore fluid pressure in the synchrotron microtomography setup enabled us to document how differential stress (\u0026amp;#8710;\u0026amp;#963;) and pore fluid pressure (P\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;f\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;) influence the dehydration of Volterra alabaster gypsum to bassanite at a constant confining pressure and temperature in 4D.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We derived data on mineral phase transformation and formation of pore networks by applying a deep-learning algorithm in ORS Dragonfly\u0026amp;#174; software, which reduced data processing times, minimized interpretation biases, and allowed analysing larger volumes. The results exhibit an extremely high accuracy compared to standard procedures. The analysis of phase proportions (gypsum, bassanite and porosity) of segmented volumes correlates very well to theoretical predictions indicating a correct segmentation from the algorithms and self-consistency of the generated datasets. Comparing results obtained\u0026amp;#160; at various \u0026amp;#8710;\u0026amp;#963; and P\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;f\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt; to the light of mechanical data and additional in-house experiments allows us to better interpret their effect on reaction duration, magnitude and textural evolution of the rock. Transient phenomena as well as individual grain transformation and growth are now traceable in a fully automated way.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Our data further our understanding of gypsum dehydration: We found that \u0026amp;#8710;\u0026amp;#963; greatly influences the assemblage of the bassanite needles, which tend to grow nearly vertical at \u0026amp;#8710;\u0026amp;#963; \u0026amp;#8773; 0. Increasing \u0026amp;#8710;\u0026amp;#963; significantly increases sample compaction. On the contrary, increasing P\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;f \u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;decreases the bulk deformation and slows down the reaction. As pores grow around bassanite needles, the control of the orientation of needles by differential stress can influence the overall pore network and thus introduce anisotropies during transient and final stages of the reaction.

Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis.   Setting 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020).   Participants 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2.   Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C.   Results  Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56% (367/650) were male. 57% (330/576) were white, 12% (67/576) South Asian, and 10% (56/576) black. 42% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; Ptextless0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64% (29/45) v 42% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73% (38/52) v 15% (62/404); Ptextless0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51% (24/47) v 28% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34% (16/47) v 10% (26/263); Ptextless0.001), myalgia (34% (15/44) v 8% (21/270); Ptextless0.001), sore throat (30% (14/47) v (12% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20% (9/46) v 3% (10/318); Ptextless0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150 × 10 9 /L (32% (16/50) v 11% (38/348); Ptextless0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C. No deaths occurred in the MIS-C group.    Conclusions Children and young people have less severe acute covid-19 than adults.

Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. The clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms can influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making: for example, significant differential therapeutic effects in sub-groups of patients with different severities of respiratory failure have already been reported for the only treatment so far shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19, dexamethasone. We obtained structured clinical data on 68914 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 33468 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 35446 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in separate cohort of community cases. A core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea co-occurred with additional symptoms in three patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were common, and a subgroup of patients reported few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis using a further 35446 individuals subsequently recruited to ISARIC-4C. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","tags":null,"title":"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Milly Lo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583499600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583499600,"objectID":"45298c1c85a740fd5e7f17d126e4ae0c","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/d2d/lo/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T22:34:51Z","relpermalink":"/d2d/lo/","section":"d2d","summary":"Much of the routine data generated during the provision of medical care in critical care units is discarded rather than fully used to help clinicians improve treatments.

Following the geometric formulation proposed by Cutler and Breiman (1994) this is achieved by approximating the convex hull of the set of observations with the archetypes such that the observations can be explained as convex combinations of the archetypes; an analogy being the colors red, green and blue that can explain the color spectrum as convex combinations of these archetypal colors. Archetypal analysis can be seen as a matrix factorization problem, and is closely related to other 'prototype' finding approaches, e.g., k-means clustering and topic modelling.\nThe standard approach of finding archetypes assumes that the observations are real valued, which, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. For example, one may ask to find archetypal responses for a set of binary questions, or archetypal document given a set of word count vectors of a set of documents.  In this talk, I will revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and discuss a probabilistic framework that accommodates these scenarios, i.e., data types such as integers, categorical, and stochastic vector. This formulation is equivalent to performing archetypal analysis in the continuous parameter space of the probability distribution than in the discrete observation space, and for a range of exponential family distributions, such as Bernoulli, Poisson, and multinomial, the resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved using majorization-minimization. For categorical variables, e.g., multiple-option questions, I will introduce an extension of this approach to a generative framework using Dirichlet prior over the mixing parameters for which the approximate posterior distribution can be efficiently inferred using variational Bayes', and associated hyperparameters help finding a suitable number of archetypes.\nI will show the application of these formulations for finding archetypal tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, archetypal customers using German credit data, archetypal images using SUN image attribute data, and archetypal behaviour from Big Five personality data. I will also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize the archetypal analysis solution, and address some recent developments in this area and some open questions.

This is usually carried out, by Posterior Predictive Check, in the observation space by assessing if replicated data generated under the fitted model looks similar to the observed data.

The principle of this approach is that if the model fits, then posterior inferences should match the prior assumptions.

Another aspect of the multiscale strategies we intend to explore is the accuracy of the molecular force fields, particularly in reproducing nitrogen isotherms, and how this affects predictions for the performance of the material in a process and the resulting ranking.","tags":[],"title":"From Crystal to Adsorption Column: Challenges in Multiscale Computational Screening of Materials for Adsorption Separation Processes","type":"d2d"},{"authors":["Debaditya Choudhury","Michael G Tanner","Sarah McAughtrie","Fei Yu","Bethany Mills","Tushar R Choudhary","Sohan Seth","Thomas H Craven","James M Stone","Ioulia K Mati","Colin J Campbell","Mark Bradley","Christopher K I Williams","Kevin Dhaliwal","Timothy A Birks","Robert R Thomson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d58477879a07546e5a3d51284ff397a8","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/publication/choudhury-endoscopic-2019/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T20:57:34.294731Z","relpermalink":"/publication/choudhury-endoscopic-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Endoscopic sensing of distal lung physiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Przybylski","Edwin van Beek","Kevin Dhaliwal","Aziz Sheikh","Azin Salimian","Sohan Seth","Giorgos Papanastasiou","Jeremy Walker","Nik Hirani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a97c96dcb16d180f5bec10cfa6e81d35","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/publication/przybylski-stratification-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-29T20:44:34.446463Z","relpermalink":"/publication/przybylski-stratification-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stratification of Fibrotic Lung Disease: Integration of Molecular Endotyping and Quantitative CT via Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537786815,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537786815,"objectID":"457c965f028c1614f1fcff304bc9d895","permalink":"https://sohanseth.github.io/talk/cmi2018/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T20:04:15+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cmi2018/","section":"talk","summary":"We address the task of estimating bacterial and cellular load in the human distal lung with fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy (FCFM).

Using this approach, we demonstrate a ~100-fold increase in SERS signal-to-fiber background ratio, and demonstrate multiple site pH sensing with a measurement accuracy of ± 0.07 pH units in the respiratory acini of an ex vivo ovine lung model.

The investigation of pulmonary nodules is time-consuming and often leads to protracted follow-up with ongoing radiological surveillance, however, clinical calculators that assess the risk of the nodule being malignant exist to help in the stratification of patients. Furthermore recent advances in interventional pulmonology include the ability to both navigate to nodules and also to perform autofluorescence endomicroscopy. In this study we assessed the efficacy of incorporating additional information from label-free fibre-based optical endomicrosopy of the nodule on assessing risk of malignancy. Using image analysis and machine learning approaches, we find that this information does not yield any gain in predictive performance in a cohort of patients.

In this article we further extend this framework to address the general case of nominal observations which includes, for example, multiple-option questionnaires. We view archetypal analysis in a generative framework: this allows explicit control over choosing a suitable number of archetypes by assigning appropriate prior information, and finding efficient update rules using variational Bayes'.

We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal soccer players based on performance data, archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data.

This technical advancement has initiated the trend of sequencing multiple samples in different conditions or environments to explore the similarities and dissimilarities of the microbial communities. Examples include the human microbiome project and various studies of the human intestinal tract. With the availability of ever larger databases of such measurements, finding samples similar to a given query sample is becoming a central operation. Results: In this paper, we develop a content-based exploration and retrieval method for whole metagenome sequencing samples. We apply a distributed string mining framework to efficiently extract all informative sequence k-mers from a pool of metagenomic samples and use them to measure the dissimilarity between two samples. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two human gut metagenome data sets as well as human microbiome project metagenomic samples. We observe significant enrichment for diseased gut samples in results of queries with another diseased sample and very high accuracy in discriminating between different body sites even though the method is unsupervised.

Developing such tools, however, is difficult due to the lack of Euclidean structure of the spike train space, and an experimenter usually prefers simpler tools that capture only limited statistical features of the spike train, such as mean spike count or mean firing rate. We explore strictly positive-definite kernels on the space of spike trains to offer both a structural representation of this space and a platform for developing statistical measures that explore features beyond count or rate. We apply these kernels to construct measures of divergence between two point processes and use them for hypothesis testing, that is, to observe if two sets of spike trains originate from the same underlying probability law. Although there exist positive-definite spike train kernels in the literature, we establish that these kernels are not strictly definite and thus do not induce measures of divergence. We discuss the properties of both of these existing nonstrict kernels and the novel strict kernels in terms of their computational complexity, choice of free parameters, and performance on both synthetic and real data through kernel principal component analysis and hypothesis testing.","tags":null,"title":"Strictly Positive-Definite Spike Train Kernels for Point-Process Divergences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sohan Seth","José C.

In this letter, we discuss a novel approach to this problem and develop a computationally simple and parameter-free estimator. The difference between the proposed approach and the existing ones is that the former expresses conditional dependence in terms of a finite set of realizations, whereas the latter use random variables, which are not available in practice. We call this approach conditional association, since it is based on a generalization of the concept of association to arbitrary metric spaces.
