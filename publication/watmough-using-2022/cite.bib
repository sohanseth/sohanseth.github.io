Physical access to health facilities is an important factor in determining treatment seeking behaviour and has implications for targets within the Sustainable Development Goals, including the right to health. The increased availability of high-resolution land cover and road data from satellite imagery offers opportunities for fine-grained estimations of physical access which can support delivery planning through the provision of more realistic estimates of travel times. The data presented here is of travel time to health facilities in Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Travel times have been calculated for different facility types in each country such as Dispensaries, Health Centres, Clinics and Hospitals. Cost allocation surfaces and travel times are provided for child walking speeds but can be altered easily to account for adult walking speeds and motorised transport. With a focus on Uganda, we describe the data and method and provide the travel maps, software and intermediate datasets for Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.},
